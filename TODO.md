## Git Worktree Branches for Phase 1

- `main` - Main development branch
- `feature/favorites` - Favorites functionality implementation
- `feature/charging-timer` - Charging timer and notifications
- `feature/native-ads` - Native advertising integration

### Worktree Setup Commands

```bash
# Create worktrees directory (already in .gitignore)
mkdir -p worktrees

# Create feature branches and worktrees
git worktree add worktrees/favorites -b feature/favorites
git worktree add worktrees/charging-timer -b feature/charging-timer
git worktree add worktrees/native-ads -b feature/native-ads
```

### Development Workflow

1. Each feature is developed in its own worktree
2. Changes are committed to feature branches
3. Pull requests are created for code review
4. Features are merged to main after testing
5. Worktrees are removed after merge:
   ```bash
   git worktree remove worktrees/[feature-name]
   git branch -d feature/[feature-name]
   ```
